	- provisioning
	- patching
	- backup
	- recovery
	- failure detection
	- repair

- Does not provide shell access to the underlying DB (as it is a managed resource and AWS owns it)

- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (AWS Proprietary DB)

## Config

- Database Engine
- License Model
- DB Engine Version
- DB Instance Class
- Multi-AZ Deployment
- Storage Type & Size
- Backups
- Monitoring
- Maitenance Window





-----


- high availbility & fault tolerance using Multi-AZ deployment option
- launch read replicas across Regions in order to provide enhanced performance and durability
## Backups

- automatically enabled
	- Daily full backup (during defined maitenance window)
	- Transaction logs are backed up every 5 min
	- 7 day retention (can be increased to 35)

- snapshots

## Auto Scaling

> ðŸ”† avoid manually scaling your database storage ðŸ‘‰ set Maximum Storage Threshold instead and let RDS handle it

## Read Replicas

> help to scale database reads

- up to 5
- Options
	- within an AZ
	- across AZ
	- across region

- ðŸ‘€ FREE as long as replicas are in the same region

## Multi Availability Zone (Disaster Recovery)

- yes you can set up read replicas to be multi availability zoned

## Encryption

> can encrypt the master & read replicas w/ AWS KMS - AWS-256

- must be defined at launch time
- if the master if NOT encrypted the read replicates CANNOT be encrypted
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle & SQL server

### In-Flight Encryption

> SSL Certificates

- enforce SSL
	- PostgreSQL : `rds.force_ssl=1` in AWS RDS Console (Parameter Group)


## IAM Database Connection

> only MySQL & PostgreSQL ðŸ‘‰ authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API calls
